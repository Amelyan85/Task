Well I'm standing by a river
But the water doesn't flow
It boils with every poison you can think of
And I'm underneath the streetlights
But the light of joy I know
Scared beyond belief, way down in the shadows
And the perverted fear of violence
Chokes a smile on every face
And common sense is ringing out the bells
